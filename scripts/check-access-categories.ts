/**
 * Every GET under /api/secure/ either has an access category or says why not (yourphr#657).
 *
 *   npm run check:categories
 *
 * The access category is what makes a read visible: it is the line in the patient's own access log
 * ("who read my record, and when") and, since agent tokens (yourphr#695), the ONLY thing a token's
 * scope can name. A route that reads record content with no category is a read the patient is never
 * told about, and one an agent token can never be granted — both silently. #599's search box was
 * exactly that until someone read the code; this makes the next one fail CI instead.
 *
 * The check reads src/server.ts statically, the way scripts/check-routes.ts does, and asks
 * accessCategoryFor() (src/account/index.ts) about every path the server can answer to a GET:
 * literal paths directly, pattern routes through sample paths expanded from their regex. A path with
 * no category must be listed below with its reason:
 *
 *   EXEMPT          — not a read of anyone's record (the caller's own account, instance settings,
 *                     admin screens, job history). A category here would be noise in the log.
 *   KNOWN_UNLOGGED  — DOES read record content and has no category yet. Each names its issue, so
 *                     the gap is tracked rather than forgotten; the fix is a category, which is a
 *                     scope-vocabulary change and therefore the operator's decision.
 *
 * What it does NOT prove: a route whose method check sits several lines away from its path test is
 * counted as GET-capable (conservative — it can only add work, never hide a read). A route built some
 * other way than `url.pathname === '…'` or `url.pathname.match(/…/)` is not seen; the list of forms
 * is at the bottom, next to the parser.
