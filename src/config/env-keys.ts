/**
 * Environment-owned configuration keys (yourphr#635), ported from ngdpbase's
 * `src/utils/configEnvKeys.ts` (its #1089).
 *
 * ngdpbase reached this from a bug worth repeating here, because this stack had the conditional
 * version of the same mistake: six keys were owned by two layers at once — the environment, via a
 * hardcoded map inside `getProperty()` that nothing outside could see, and the admin configuration
 * screen, which accepted and persisted edits to them that could never take effect.
 *
 * The rule it restores: __a configuration key is owned by exactly one layer, never both.__
 * Ownership is DECLARED in `yourphr.config.env-keys` — a map rather than an array, because the UI
 * needs the variable's name to tell an operator where the value actually lives.
 *
 * Two decisions carried over deliberately:
 *
 * - __Ownership is not conditional on the variable being set.__ A key in the map is env-owned
 *   whether or not anything is currently exporting it. Making it conditional would hand the UI the
 *   source of truth whenever the variable is absent, which is precisely the ambiguity being
 *   removed. This stack previously refused a write only while the variable happened to be set, so
 *   the same key was editable on one instance and refused on another.
 * - __The shipped value is a boot fallback, not a setting.__ `yourphr.web.listen.port: 8080` exists
 *   so a fresh install comes up. The screen still reports it as the EFFECTIVE value when nothing
 *   overrides it, because it must show what is actually in force — but the field stays read-only.

 * It exists because the alternative failure mode is worse: without it, a partial or unreadable
 * default config makes every environment override silently stop working, including the at-rest
 * database key. An override that keeps working is a safer degradation than one that vanishes
 * without a word.
 *
 * Keep in step with `yourphr.config.env-keys` in `config/app-default-config.json`; a drift here
 * only shows up when the config cannot be read at all.
