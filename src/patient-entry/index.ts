/**
 * What the PATIENT enters about themselves, turned into the record FHIR already has for it
 * (yourphr#696, #763; the product's #313).
 *
 * A home vital is an Observation; an allergy, medication, visit, or implant is its corresponding
 * FHIR resource, built in its own file and reached through `buildPatientRecord`. The rules they
 * share — patient-generated marks, keep what was said, invent nothing — live in `shared.ts`.
 *
 * "Add record" is a primary call to action in three places in the app, and its form posted to a
 * route this stack never had — so the form filled in, submitted, and 404'd. This is the half that
 * was missing, ported decision-for-decision from Go's `patient_entry.go` at v2.10.3 so that a
 * record entered on v2 and one entered here are the same record: same LOINC codes, same UCUM units,
 * same category, same shape.
 *
 * Two properties it must keep:
 *
 *   - __It is patient-reported, and says so.__ `meta.tag` carries `patient-reported` and
 *     `meta.source` the patient-UI marker, exactly as Go wrote them. A hand-typed blood pressure
 *     must never be mistaken for one a hospital asserted — the manager files it under the person's
 *     own `manual` source for the same reason.
 *   - __It states only what the person entered, and it never loses what they said.__ A vital this
 *     module cannot code is stored with their words as `code.text` and NO coding, which is what a
 *     CodeableConcept is for; an incomplete reading keeps the half that was measured. Such a record
 *     carries `needs-review` and is held out of the chart until a person resolves it — kept as a
 *     fact, not counted as a chart fact. Nothing missing is ever invented: no unit conversion, no
 *     guessed code, no date supplied for one that could not be read.
